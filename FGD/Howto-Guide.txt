The following folder contains all of the files you need to docker build a new discord bot python code that triggers a screenshot of the fear & greed CNN site and sends it to your private channel.

Guide:
1. setup a bot with read/write permissions (its easy, look for a generic YT video and you are done)
2. invite that bot to a channel you own
3. donwload the FGD folder and run "docker build -t my_discord_bot ." to build the image.
4. pull and run the selenium image (there are lots of errors over in docker trying to run chromedriver locally so using selenium docker app is better).
"docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 7900:7900 --shm-size="2g" selenium/standalone-chrome:latest"
5. run the discord bot image, "docker run -it my_discord_bot".
you can also run it interactively to run the code manually and debug issues, "docker run -it my_discord_bot /bin/bash"
6. Let it run via your local machine, cloud node or anything quite literally.

*Important: inside the python script there is a default IP & PORT defined for the remote webdriver usage so check under http://[HOST]:4444/ui/ what is the IP of the running chromedriver session and change it if needed.*
